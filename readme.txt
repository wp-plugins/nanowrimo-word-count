A plugin that let's you keep track of your word count for NaNoWriMo

== Description ==

November is National Novel Writing month, and I realized that Wordpress would be a great platform to write a novel.

In order to use this plugin, each of your posts that you are using for NaNoWriMo has to be in the same category.

To display all of the word counts of your posts in said category, just put [nanowc] onto the page that you want those to show.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `nano-wc` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Select a category that you want your word counts

== Remove plugin ==

1. Deactivate plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
2. Delete plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

It's best to use the build in delete function of wordpress.
